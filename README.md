Uniform: Sexy forms with JQuery for Joomla

This is an adaptation making it possible to use Uniform Sexy forms with Jquery in a Joomla CMS. I have added the ability to easily add additional themes as well as control which elements to style with Uniform. 

This is my first Github project, I have a ton more awesome plugins I have written that I will be posting. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!
